Now add SOFT rule validations. These are different from strict rules — 
they block submission by default, BUT the user can override them.

Soft rules:
1. Date of Birth: Candidate must be between 18 and 35 years old 
   (calculated from today's date to DOB). 
2. Graduation Year: Must be between 2015 and 2025.
3. Percentage/CGPA: If in percentage mode, must be >= 60%. 
   If in CGPA mode (10-point scale), must be >= 6.0.
4. Screening Test Score: Must be >= 40 out of 100.

When a soft rule is violated:
- Show a yellow/amber warning (not red error) below the field
- Show a toggle/checkbox labeled "Request Exception"
- When the toggle is ON, show a text area labeled "Exception Rationale"
- The rationale must be at least 30 characters long
- The rationale must contain at least ONE of these phrases: 
  "approved by", "special case", "documentation pending", "waiver granted"
- If the rationale doesn't meet these conditions, show a helpful error 
  message explaining what's needed
- If the rationale IS valid, the soft rule violation is overridden 
  and submission is allowed

Keep the form visually clear — strict errors in red, soft warnings in 
amber/yellow, valid fields in green.
